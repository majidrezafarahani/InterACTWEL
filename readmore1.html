            <h2>What is InterACTWEL?</h2>
           <!-- <p style="text-align:justify">
                (Interactive Adaptation and Collaboration Tool for managing Water, Energy and Land)
                InterACTWEL is a computer-aided decision support tool that is being developed to empower land, water,
                energy managers and food producers to envision and plan towards a resilient future for their local communities.
                Unlike other tools that focus on the short-term decision-making, InterACTWEL will help communities identify
                decisions for long-term adaptation to changes that they do not have control of, such as a severe water restriction
                or changing state laws.
                To make this tool successful, we need to hear from water, energy managers, and food producers about their
                current and future management concerns and the types of information needed to make more informed management
                decisions and long-term plans.
                Because natural resources are limited, many communities need assistance to effectively coordinate demand,
                allocation and efficient use of water, energy and land. Coordination among stakeholders is especially critical
                when resource availability and quality is threatened. Stakeholders may include those whose livelihoods depend
                on food and energy production, as well as availability of water for consumptive uses (e.g., industry, agriculture,
                drinking water) as well as non-consumptive uses (e.g., fisheries, ecosystem maintenance, recreation, navigation,
                hydropower, cultural preservation). Food-Energy-Water (FEW) actors often include farmers, tribes, water managers,
                dam operators, industries, recreationalists, government agencies and environmentalists. InterACTWEL is a
                computer-aided decision support tool that empowers FEW actors to envision and plan towards a resilient future
                for their local communities. Unlike other tools that focus on the short-term decision-making, InterACTWEL in
                a long-term planning tool that help communities be more resilient to changes that they do not have control of,
                such as a severe water restriction or changing state laws. Whenever there is an environmental disturbance (e.g.,
                extreme floods, droughts, groundwater declines, fish diseases) or when there are new agricultural or
                environmental policies, FEW actors can use InterACTWELs intuitive interfaces to examine how these factors
                will affect their goals, operations and livelihoods. The scientific models in InterACTWEL allow individual
                actors to identify potential adaptation strategies from a wide range of management choices available to them,
                while also enabling them to learn about how their decisions affect other FEW actors. With InterACTWEL local
                communities of FEW actors can increase their overall capacity to adjust their operations through time, for
                uncertain and adverse stresses affecting the environment or the economy. Anyone can use and access InterACTWEL;
                the data-secure tool is easy to navigate and can run on either a desktop or mobile application. How it works:
                InterACTWEL goes well beyond just being a web-based platform to share data and information among FEW actors in
                a local region. The system contains advanced scientific models and interactive optimization algorithms that can
                quickly synthesize and leverage the collective wisdom of FEW actors. The algorithms help identify potential
                adaptation strategies, while also meeting environmental, economic and social sustainability goals. InterACTWEL
                allows FEW actors to upload and connect their own trusted scientific models such as hydrologic, economic or crop
                growth models for analyses of their sector. If a FEW actors model is overly complex, then users can upload
                results from their own simulation models via a graphical user interface. The machine-learning algorithms
                in InterACTWEL will then create fast surrogate models to represent the FEW actors system in the adaptation
                planning framework. InterACTWEL is highly flexible. It allows individuals and groups to modify the decisions
                proposed by the optimization algorithms while also accepting new information at any time. If FEW actors are
                unsatisfied with the scenarios for water and natural resource use that InterACTWEL provides, then they can
                modify the scenarios, and the tool will adapt to the new preferences. All of this is accomplished in a secure
                and trusted cyber environment. If a FEW actor is considering a potential strategy, it can be kept private and
                not shared with other users. InterACTWEL is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute
                of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) via an interagency partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and
                USDA-NIFA.

            <p style="text-align:justify">
                The limited nature of our shared resources drives the need for assistance to effectively coordinate demand, allocation, and efficient use of water, energy,
                and land within communities. This reality, compounded by threatened resource quality, requires coordination among stakeholders whose livelihoods depend on
                food and energy production and availability of water for consumptive and non- consumptive uses; these include: farmers, tribes, water managers, dam operators,
                industries, recreationalists, government agencies, and environmentalists. InterACTWEL, a secure and intelligent computer-aided decision support tool, empowers
                such actors to collaborate and coordinate management of natural resources over time. This highly flexible and navigable tool can be utilized in times of
                environmental disturbance or during implementation of new agricultural or environmental policies. Its intuitive interface examines impacts to goals,
                operations, and livelihoods for smarter natural resource management (i.e. adaptive management). To do so, this tool contains advanced scientific models
                and interactive optimization algorithms that allow individual actors to identify potential adaptation strategies while learning how those strategies affect
                other actors.

                InterACTWEL is funded by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) via an interagency partnership with
                the National Science Foundation (NSF).

            <h2 id="C5">Why use InterACTWEL</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                Persistent threats that impair water, energy, and land resources compound the challenge for communities to adapt to sudden unexpected changes.
                With InterACTWEL, community leaders, citizens, and government agencies will be able to understand the potential impacts of persistent and sudden
                threats to water, energy and land resources before they happen, and have available a “menu” of response actions. This “menu” of actions will be scored
                for a wide range of economic, environmental and social metrics.

                In essence, InterACTWEL aims to help land, water, energy managers, and food producers identify long-term management options that respond to potential
                threats and can empower coordination of management efforts.
