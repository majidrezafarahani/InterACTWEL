                 (Interactive Adaptation and Collaboration Tool for managing Water, Energy and Land)
                 InterACTWEL is a computer-aided decision support tool that is being developed to empower land, water,
                 energy managers and food producers to envision and plan towards a resilient future for their local communities.
                 Unlike other tools that focus on the short-term decision-making, InterACTWEL will help communities identify
                 decisions for long-term adaptation to changes that they do not have control of, such as a severe water restriction
                 or changing state laws.
                 To make this tool successful, we need to hear from water, energy managers, and food producers about their
                 current and future management concerns and the types of information needed to make more informed management
                 decisions and long-term plans.
                 Because natural resources are limited, many communities need assistance to effectively coordinate demand,
                 allocation and efficient use of water, energy and land. Coordination among stakeholders is especially critical
                 when resource availability and quality is threatened. Stakeholders may include those whose livelihoods depend
                 on food and energy production, as well as availability of water for consumptive uses (e.g., industry, agriculture,
                 drinking water) as well as non-consumptive uses (e.g., fisheries, ecosystem maintenance, recreation, navigation,
                 hydropower, cultural preservation). Food-Energy-Water (FEW) actors often include farmers, tribes, water managers,
                 dam operators, industries, recreationalists, government agencies and environmentalists. InterACTWEL is a
                 computer-aided decision support tool that empowers FEW actors to envision and plan towards a resilient future
                 for their local communities. Unlike other tools that focus on the short-term decision-making, InterACTWEL in
                 a long-term planning tool that help communities be more resilient to changes that they do not have control of,
                 such as a severe water restriction or changing state laws. Whenever there is an environmental disturbance (e.g.,
                 extreme floods, droughts, groundwater declines, fish diseases) or when there are new agricultural or
                 environmental policies, FEW actors can use InterACTWELs intuitive interfaces to examine how these factors
                 will affect their goals, operations and livelihoods. The scientific models in InterACTWEL allow individual
                 actors to identify potential adaptation strategies from a wide range of management choices available to them,
                 while also enabling them to learn about how their decisions affect other FEW actors. With InterACTWEL local
                 communities of FEW actors can increase their overall capacity to adjust their operations through time, for
                 uncertain and adverse stresses affecting the environment or the economy. Anyone can use and access InterACTWEL;
                 the data-secure tool is easy to navigate and can run on either a desktop or mobile application. How it works:
                 InterACTWEL goes well beyond just being a web-based platform to share data and information among FEW actors in
                 a local region. The system contains advanced scientific models and interactive optimization algorithms that can
                 quickly synthesize and leverage the collective wisdom of FEW actors. The algorithms help identify potential
                 adaptation strategies, while also meeting environmental, economic and social sustainability goals. InterACTWEL
                 allows FEW actors to upload and connect their own trusted scientific models such as hydrologic, economic or crop
                 growth models for analyses of their sector. If a FEW actors model is overly complex, then users can upload
                 results from their own simulation models via a graphical user interface. The machine-learning algorithms
                 in InterACTWEL will then create fast surrogate models to represent the FEW actors system in the adaptation
                 planning framework. InterACTWEL is highly flexible. It allows individuals and groups to modify the decisions
                 proposed by the optimization algorithms while also accepting new information at any time. If FEW actors are
                 unsatisfied with the scenarios for water and natural resource use that InterACTWEL provides, then they can
                 modify the scenarios, and the tool will adapt to the new preferences. All of this is accomplished in a secure
                 and trusted cyber environment. If a FEW actor is considering a potential strategy, it can be kept private and
                 not shared with other users. InterACTWEL is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute
                 of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) via an interagency partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and
                 USDA-NIFA.

                Water resources in the Umatilla sub basin include surface water, ground water and waste water.
                Surface water is derived from Columbia River and its tributaries such as Umatilla River, ponds
                and water reservoirs. Groundwater is an important resource to the economy of Umatilla County
                by providing the bulk of the water used for agriculture, as well as for drinking water supplies for
                the many communities and nearly all of the rural residences. The Umatilla Basin has more
                groundwater resource areas determined to be “Critical” by the Oregon Water Resources
                Department than any other part of Oregon. Waste water is coming from residential areas and
                food processing industries.
                According to Mucken and Bateman (2017) report, quality of surface water and ground water is
                critical for residential, agricultural and industrial use and being monitored by Oregon
                Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).

            <p style="text-align:justify">

                Temperature, sedimentation, and nutrients are the most common types of pollution that impair
                Oregon’s rivers and streams. Impaired water quality drives up the cost of water treatment and
                limits access to clean water for fish, drinking water, agriculture, and recreation.

            <p style="text-align:justify">

                Groundwater contamination is also a serious issue in some areas of Oregon. Private domestic
                wells may face contamination issues from nearby failing septic systems. Industry and agriculture
                can also be a source of pollutants for groundwater, as can surface water and groundwater
                interactions.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
                Most of DEQ’s groundwater monitoring efforts target vulnerable areas or areas of known
                contamination (i.e., Groundwater Management Areas (GWMAs)). Nitrate is one of the most
                commonly analyzed contaminants in these areas, with data showing that around 30 percent of
                groundwater samples detect nitrate at levels that suggest a 22 Chapter 1 – Understand Water
                Resources Today pollution problem exists (7 mg/L), and around 20 percent currently exceed
                health standards (10 mg/L). Bacteria are a commonly detected contaminant as well, with about
                20 percent of samples showing positive bacteria detections. Arsenic is not as commonly studied,
                but when sampled in vulnerable groundwater areas, about 30 percent of samples show levels
                above health standards (10 ug/L). Other contaminants detected in groundwater studies include
                Dacthal, manganese, lead, iron, aluminum, perchlorate, uranium and vanadium. There have been
                few studies that investigate contaminants such as current use and legacy pesticides, herbicides,
                pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and volatile organic compounds. Based on data
                collected in the past five years, when detections of those contaminants are found, they are often
                far below health standards, if any standards exist.
